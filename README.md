# rock-paper-scissors
First JS repo made for playing rock-paper-sissors - initially, on the console.log().

# Update 07-30-2024
After some editings on the code, I decided to try doing it differently than Odin Projects curriculum would suggest. Odin suggested to do different functions for rounds and for the game completely, however, I had a hard time making it work like that. 

As I want to progress with other challenges and had the wish to complete this project, I attempted to do it how I thought it could work - trying over and over again. 

At this final/current version, I decided to place the entire game on the same function. I may need to review it in the future if the needs of the project chance, however, it is currently delivering the exercise challenges, such as: 

**Step 1:** Setup the project structure
**Step 2:** Write the logic to get the computer choice
**Step 3:** Write the logic to get the human choice
**Step 4:** Declare the players score variables
**Step 5:** Write the logic to play a single round
**Step 6:** Write the logic to play the entire game

I hope you enjoy it :)
